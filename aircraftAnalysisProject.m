% Plot the following:
% Tr and Ta vs velocity at sea level
% Pr and Pa vs velocity at sea level, 15,000 ft, and 20,000 ft
% Rate of climb vs velocity at sea level
% Table with info requested by Fury (range, endurance, ceiling)
% 1) What's their maximum range, and at what velocity and altitude?
% 2) What's their maximum endurance, and at what velocity and altitude?
% 3) The helicarrier has an operating altitude of 15,000 ft. If these aircrafts engage the
% helicarrier, whatï¿½s the max duration could they operate?
% 4) What's their best absolute and service ceiling? And at what velocities?
% 5) What's their max rate of climb at sea level?
